ÇhÅ[Ç| mÄ-- Å[Ä markÇ|

ÇpÄpushes  a  ÑmarkÄ object on the operand stack.  The typical  use  of  this 
Äoperator  is to mark the beginning of a sequence of objects that will  be 
Äpackaged into a new list object by the Å] Äoperator.Ç|

ÇxÄSEE ALSO:Å ]Ç| 1 ls

ÇhÅ]Ç| mÄmark obj†1Ä..obj†nÄ Å]Ä listÇ| n

ÇpÄcreates  a  new list of n elements,  where n is the  number  of  objects 
Äfollowing  the topmost mark on the operand stack,  stores those  elements 
Äinto  the list,  and returns the list on the operand  stack.  The  object 
Äfollowing  the  mark will become element 0 of the list,  and  the  object 
Äbefore Å]Ä, the (n-1)th element. The mark and the list elements are removed 
Äfrom the stack before the list object is pushed.Ç|

ÇxÄEXAMPLE:Ç|
ÇyÄ[7 3 6.4 true] => Ña 4-element list, of elements 7, 3, 6.4, trueÇ|
ÇyÄ[8 9 add] => Ña 1-element list, containing 17Ç|
ÇyÄ[x y z] => Ña 3-element list, of objects associated with 'x',..Ç|

ÇpÄThe  second line illustrates that the D machine ÑexecutesÄ the objects  it 
Äencounters between '[ ]' (whereas enumerations of other composite objects 
Äare simply translated into their internal form and saved as the value  of 
Äthe object). Thus, the 'add' invokes the associated operator, whereas the 
Äexecution  of the numerals simply transfers these to the stack,  so  they 
Äpile up as typed.Ç|

ÇpÄThe last line of the example points out that the objects associated with 
ÑactiveÄ names,  rather than these names, will become elements of the list. 
ÄThus,  re-definition  of such names after forming the list will  not  re-
Ädefine the elements of the list.Ç| 1 ls

ÇhÅabortÇ| mÄ-- ÅabortÄ --Ç|

ÇpÄterminates  execution of the current context. ÑabortÄ clears the operand and Äexecution stacks and removes all but Ñsystemdict Ä and Ñuserdict Äfrom the Ädictionary stack.Ç|

ÇxÄSEE ALSO: Åhalt, continue, exit, stop, stoppedÇ| 1 ls

ÇhÅabsÇ| mÄnum ÅabsÄ numÇ| 1 ls
Ç      mÄarray ÅabsÄ arrayÇ|

ÇpÄreturns the absolute value of a numeral,  or replaces all elements of an 
Äarray by their absolute values and returns the array object.  The numerical 
Ätype  of the result is that of the operand.  An ÑundefinedÄ  operand  value 
Äproduces an ÑundefinedÄ result value.Ç|

ÇxÄEXAMPLES:Ç|
ÇyÄ99.9 abs => 99.9Ç|
ÇyÄ-1875 abs => 1875Ç|
ÇyÄ<w 7 -2 0> abs => <w 7 2 0>Ç| 1 ls

ÇhÅacosÇ| mÄnum ÅacosÄ numÇ| 1 ls
Ç       mÄarray ÅacosÄ arrayÇ|

ÇpÄreturns the arccosine of a numeral, or replaces all elements of an array by 
Ätheir arccosines and returns the array object. The result is in radians. The Änumerical type of the result is that of the operand. An ÑundefinedÄ operand value Äproduces an ÑundefinedÄ result value, and operand values of absolute values Ägreater than 1 yield an ÑundefinedÄ result.Ç|

ÇxÄEXAMPLE:Ç|
ÇyÄ0.5 acos => 1.047197551196598Ç| 

ÇxÄSEE ALSO: ÅcosÇ| 1 ls


ÇhÅactiveÇ| mÄany ÅactiveÄ boolÇ|

ÇpÄdetermines  whether  ÑanyÄ carries the ÑactiveÄ (as  opposed  to  the 
ÑpassiveÄ) attribute and returns ÑtrueÄ if the object is ÑactiveÄ, ÑfalseÄ if the 
Äobject is ÑpassiveÄ.Ç|

Ç      mÄarray num ÅaddÄ arrayÇ| 1 ls
Ç      mÄnum array ÅaddÄ numÇ|

ÇpÄadds two numerals and returns their sum, or adds the elements of Ñarray§2Ñ Äto 
Äthe corresponding elements of Ñarray§1Ñ Äand returns Ñarray§1Ä,  or adds a numeral 
Äto all elements of ÑarrayÄ and returns ÑarrayÄ, or adds the sum of all elements of ÑarrayÄ to ÑnumÄ and returns the sum in ÑnumÄ.Ç|

ÇpÄAll types of numerical values are accepted in any combination. Operand values Äare converted to Ñdouble Ätype prior to the operation, and the result is returned Äin the type of the pivotal operand.Ç|

ÇpÑUndefinedÄ  operand values are propagated into a corresponding  ÑundefinedÄ 
Äresult,   and  arithmetical  overflow  produces  corresponding  ÑundefinedÄ 
Ävalues.Ç|

ÇxÄEXAMPLES:Ç|
ÇyÄ17 4 add => 21Ç|
ÇyÄ1.5 2 add => 3.5Ç|
ÇyÄ1 2.5 add => 3Ç|

Ç                                             @Ñ if not found:Ä string falseÇ|

ÇpÄdetermines  whether  the string ÑseekÄ matches the  initial  substring  of 
ÑstringÄ (that is, ÑstringÄ is at least as long as ÑseekÄ and the corresponding 
Ächaracters are equal). If so, ÑstringÄ is split into two substrings: ÑmatchÄ, 
Äthe  portion  of ÑstringÄ that matches ÑseekÄ,  and ÑpostÄ,  the  remainder  of 
ÑstringÄ; ÑpostÄ,  ÑmatchÄ,  and  the boolean ÑtrueÄ are pushed  onto  the 
Äoperand stack. If not, the original ÑstringÄ and ÑfalseÄ are returned.Ç|

ÇxÄEXAMPLES:Ç|
ÇyÄ(abcd) (ab) anchorsearch => (cd) (ab) trueÇ|
ÇyÄ(abcd) (bc) anchorsearch => (abcd) falseÇ|

Ç      mÄnum†1Ä num†2Ä ÅandÄ numÇ|

ÇpÄreturns the logical conjunction of two booleans, or the bitwise 'and' of 
Äthe  binary  representations  of  two  numerals. The second numeral operand is Äextended by leading zeroes if necessary to match a pivotal numeral operand, and Äthe operation is performed over the length of the pivotal operand. Ñand Ä treats ÑundefinedÄ numeral values like any other value (the ÑundefinedÄ bit pattern of an Äinteger has a true sign bit and false in all other positions).Ç|

ÇxÄEXAMPLES:Ç|
ÇyÄtrue true and => trueÇ|
ÇyÄtrue false and => falseÇ|
ÇyÄfalse true and => falseÇ|

ÇhÅarrayÇ| mÄn /type ÅarrayÄ arrayÇ|

ÇpÄcreates  an  array  of length ÑnÄ and numeral type ÑtypeÄ  (specified  by  a 
Äpassive name whose first letter is a type specifier,  b/B,  w/W,  l/L, or 
Äs/S).  The  array object is returned on the operand  stack.  The  maximal 
Äallowed array length is limited by the space available in the VM.Ç| 1 ls

ÇhÅasinÇ| mÄnum ÅasinÄ numÇ| 1 ls
Ç       mÄarray ÅasinÄ arrayÇ|

ÇpÄreturns the arcsine of a numeral, or replaces all elements of an array by 
Ätheir arcsines and returns the array object. The result is in radians. The Änumerical type of the result is that of the operand. An ÑundefinedÄ operand value Äproduces an ÑundefinedÄ result value, and operand values of absolute values Ägreater than 1 yield an ÑundefinedÄ result.Ç|

ÇxÄEXAMPLE:Ç|
ÇyÄ0.5 asin => 0.5235987755982989e-1Ç| 1 ls

ÇhÅatanÇ| mÄnum ÅatanÄ numÇ| 1 ls
Ç       mÄarray ÅatanÄ arrayÇ|

ÇpÄreturns the arctangent of a numeral, or replaces all elements of an array by 
Ätheir arctangents and returns the array object. The result is in radians. The Änumerical type of the result is that of the operand. An ÑundefinedÄ operand value Äproduces an ÑundefinedÄ result valueÅ.Ç|

ÇxÄEXAMPLE:Ç|

ÇxÄSEE ALSO: ÅtanÇ| 1 ls

ÇhÅbeginÇ| mÄdict Åbegin Ä--Ç|

ÇpÄpushes  the  dictionary  ÑdictÄ on the dictionary  stack,  making  it  the 
Äcurrent  dictionary  and installing it as the first of  the  dictionaries 
Äthat define the current vocabulary.Ç|

ÇpÑbeginÄ uses only dictionaries whose values are stored in internal VM.Ç|

ÇxÄSEE ALSO: Åend, countdictstack, dictstackÇ| 1 ls

ÇhÅbindÇ| mÄproc ÅbindÄ procÇ|

ÇpÄreplaces active operator names in ÑprocÄ by their values. For each element 
Äin ÑprocÄ that is an active name,  ÑbindÄ looks up the name in the context of 
Äthe current dictionary stack. If the name is found and is associated with 
Äan operator object,  ÑbindÄ replaces the name by the operator in  ÑprocÄ.  If 
Äthe name is not found or does not resolve to an operator,  ÑbindÄ makes  no 
Ächange.Ç|

ÇpÄAdditionally, for each procedure object in ÑprocÄ that is not protected by 
Äthe  Ñread-onlyÄ  attribute,   ÑbindÄ  applies  itself  recursively  to  that 
Äprocedure, makes the procedure Ñread-onlyÄ, and stores it back into ÑprocÄ.Ç|

ÇpÄThere  are  two  benefits of  binding  a  procedure.  Firstly,  a  bound 
Äprocedure will always execute using the operators that were intended when 
Äthe  procedure  was defined,  even if some operator names have  been  re-
Ädefined  in  the meantime.  Secondly,  the procedure  will  run  somewhat 
Äfaster,  as  operators  are  executed immediately  rather  than  after  a 
Ädictionary search. In other words, binding has effects analogous to those 
Äof 'compilation': it finalizes references made through (operator) names.Ç|

ÇpÄProcedures submitted to ÑbindÄ have to reside in internal VM.Ç| 1 ls

ÇhÅbitshiftÇ| mÄnum shiftÅ bitshiftÄ numÇ|

ÇpÄshifts  the 
Äbinary  representation  of ÑnumÄ left by ÑshiftÄ bits.  If ÑshiftÄ is negative, a Äright shift by Ñ-shiftÄ bits is performed. 
ÑbitshiftÄ assigns zeroes to bits shifted into the value,  and discards the 
Äbits  shifted  out.   ÑbitshiftÄ  thus  performs  a  logical  (rather  than 
Äarithmetical) shift.Ç|

ÇxÄEXAMPLES:Ç|
ÇyÄ5 4 bitshift => 80Ç|
ÇyÄ200 -1 bitshift => 100Ç| 1 ls

ÇhÅcapsaveÇ| mÄsavebox ÅcapsaveÄ --Ç| 1 ls

ÇpÄconcludes the range of discardable VM objects in ÑsaveboxÄ. ÑrestoreÄ 
Äapplied to that box will discard all internal VM objects created between the Äinstance of ÑsaveÄ that created the box and the instance of ÑcapsaveÄ. If Ñcapsave ÄisÄ applied more than once to the same box object, it expands the discardable VM Ärange to include also the objects created since the previous instance of ÑcapsaveÄ.Ç|

ÇxÄSEE ALSO: Åsave, restoreÇ| 1 ls


ÇhÅceilÇ| mÄnum ÅceilÄ numÇ| 1 ls
Ç       mÄarray ÅceilÄ arrayÇ|

ÇpÄreturns the ceiling (i.e. the nearest integer value greater than the operand)Å Äof a numeral, or replaces all elements of an array by their ceilings and returnsÄ the array object. The numerical type of the result is that of the operand. An ÑundefinedÄ operand value produces an ÑundefinedÄ result value.Ç|

ÇxÄEXAMPLE:Ç|
ÇyÄ1.45 ceil =>2.0Ç| 1 ls

ÇxÄSEE ALSO: ÅfloorÇ| 1 ls

ÇhÅclassÇ| mÄany ÅclassÄ /nameÇ|

ÇpÄreturns a passive name that defines the ÑclassÄ of ÑanyÄ  object,  i.e.  one 
Äof:  /nullclass,  /markclass,  numclass, /opclass, /nameclass, /boolclass, 
Ä/arrayclass, /listclass, /dictclass, /boxclass.Ç|

ÇpÄThe  ÑclassÄ  operator  is useful in procedures that  tune  themselves  to 
Ädifferent classes of operand.  A method to implement such a procedure  is 
Äillustrated in the following example.Ç|

ÇxÄEXAMPLE:Ç|
ÇyÄ/printclasses 10 dict dup beginÇ|
ÇyÄ  /nullclass { ... } defÇ|
ÇyÄ  ...Ç|
ÇyÄ  /boxclass { ... } defÇ|
ÇyÄend defÇ| 1 ls
ÇyÄ/printobject {Ç|
Çy Ä dup class makeact printclasses begin exec endÇ|
ÇyÄ} defÇ|

ÇpÄA  dictionary,Ñ  printclassesÄ,  is created to hold procedures  associated 
Äwith  the  class names.  Each of these procedures expects to  receive  an 
Äoperand  of  a  particular class on the operand stack  and  contains  the 
Äinstructions  to  print  the  value  of  that  operand.  The  ÑprintobjectÄ 
Äprocedure receives any object on the operand stack,  duplicates  it,  and 
Äuses one copy to determine the class of the object. The resulting name is 
Ägiven  the ÑactiveÄ attribute (ÑmakeactÄ) and submitted to  execution  (ÑexecÄ) 
Äafter making ÑprintclassesÄ the current dictionary.  This will invoke the Äprocedure  associated  with 
Äthe class name in ÑprintclassesÄ, which prints the first copy of the object 
Äpassed to it on the operand stack.Ç|

ÇpÄThis technique generally is the basis for using the existing D machinery 
Äin  interpreting keywords,  or,  at a larger scale,  secondary  (problem-
Äoriented) languages.  It provides two good things for free:  a clean  and 
Äopen program structure, and access to a very fast lookup machinery.Ç|

ÇxÄSEE ALSO: ÅtypeÇ| 1 ls

ÇhÅclearÇ| mÄ|- any†1Ä..any†nÄ ÅclearÄ |-Ç|

ÇhÅcleartomarkÇ| mÄmark obj†1Ä..obj†nÄ ÅcleartomarkÄ --Ç|

ÇpÄpops the operand stack repeatedly until it encounters a mark,  then pops 
Äthe mark as well.Ç| 1 ls

ÇhÅcloseportÇ| mÄ-- ÅcloseportÄ --Ç|

ÇpÄterminates the port session started by the latest instance of ÑportsessionÄ. 
ÑcloseportÄ pushes the boolean ÑfalseÄ on the operand stack and continues execution Äwith the object following the ÑportsessionÄ operator. Ñcloseport Ätypically is Äexecuted in the context of a port-serving procedure, but may be invoked in otherÄ ways, for instance, from the console. See ÑportsessionÄ for an example.Ç|

ÇxÄSEE ALSO: Åportsession, stop, abortÇ| 1 ls

ÇhÅcontinueÇ| mÄ-- ÅcontinueÄ --Ç|

ÇpÄdrops the execution stack to below the topmost Ñhalt Äoperator object, thus Äresuming execution of the context that was suspended by that instance of ÑhaltÄ.Ç|

ÇxÄSEE ALSO: Åhalt, abort, stopÇ| 1 ls

Ç       mÄlist1 list2 ÅcopyÄ sublist2Ç| 1 ls

ÇpÄIf the operand on top of the operand stack is a numeral,  ÑcopyÄ pops that 
Änumber  from  the  stack and then duplicates the top ÑnÄ  elements  of  the 
Ästack if ÑnÄ is greater than zero.Ç|

ÇpÄIn  the  second instance,  the first array is copied  into  the  initial 
Äsubarray  of the second array and the subarray is returned on the  stack; 
Äthe length of the second array has to be at least as great as that of the 
Äfirst array, and elements of the second array that are not matched by the 
Äfirst array are not affected.  If a numeral is used as the first operand, 
Äits  value  is copied into all elements of the array,  and the  array  is 
Äreturned.  The type of copied values is converted to the numeral type  of 
Äthe  target as necessary;  (old and new) ÑundefinedÄ values are passed  on.Ç|

ÇpÄWith list objects as operands,  ÑcopyÄ copies the values of the first list 
Äinto  the initial sublist of the second operand and returns the  sublist. 
ÄThe length of the second list has to be at least as great as that of  the 
Äfirst,  and elements of the second list not matched by the first are  not 
Äaffected.Ç|

ÇpÑCopyÄ physically transfers values from one list to another. If the copied 
Äsource  list  value  contains composite  objects,  these  are  copied  as 
Ädescriptions.  In other words,  ÑcopyÄ does not apply itself recursively to 
Äcomposite objects: it copies only one level of values.Ç|

ÇpÄThe  object  returned  by ÑcopyÄ has the  attributes  of  the  destination 
Äobject. Note that ÑcopyÄ is restricted to internal objects.Ç|

ÇxÄEXAMPLES:Ç|
ÇyÄ4 5 6 7 2 copy => 4 5 6 7 6 7Ç|

ÇhÅcosÇ| mÄnum ÅcosÄ numÇ| 1 ls
Ç      mÄarrayÅ cosÄ arrayÇ|


ÇpÄreturns the cosine of the operand value, which is interpreted to be in

Ç        mÄarray†1Ä /type ÅctypeÄ array†2Ç|

ÇpÄconverts both the type specifier and the value of Ñnum§1Ä to the new  ÑtypeÄ, 
Äwhich  is specified by a passive name whose initial character is  one  of 
Äb/B,  w/W, l/L, s/S, or d/D). The converted numeral is returned on the operand 
Ästack. In the case of an array, Ñctype Äconverts only the type specifier in 
Äthe object description,  but leaves the value unchanged. Hence, Ñctype Äre-
Ädirects the interpretation of the same binary value by operators that use 
Äthe  converted  array object (actual conversion of  an  array  value,  by 
Äcontrast,  is effected by the ÑcopyÄ operator).  ÑctypeÄ may also adjust  the 
Älength  (number of elements) for the new array as necessary to match  the 
Äactual space occupied by the value.Ç|

ÇpÑctypeÄ accepts internal and external arrays.Ç|

ÇhÅdecode_85Ç| mÄstring_85 stringbuf Ådecode_85Ä substring boolÇ|

ÇpÄconverts a string that holds binary information in the form of ASCII85 code Äinto a binary string, which overwrites the initial ÑsubstringÄ of  ÑstringbufÄ. The 
Äreturned boolean indicates whether the converted string was truncated due to an
Äinsufficient size of ÑstringbufÄ. The decoded string generally is smaller than theÄ encoded string (as encoding typically generates 5 bytes for each 4 original Äbytes). ASCII85 encoding is used to transfer binary strings (like bit map Äimages) to a PostScript printer; the format is described in the PostScript ÄLanguage Reference Manual (2nd edition).Ç|

ÇxÄSEE ALSO: Åencode_85Ç| 1 ls
ÇhÅdefÇ| mÄkey valueÅ defÄ --Ç|

ÇpÄassociates  ÑkeyÄ (a Ñpassive Äname) with ÑvalueÄ (any object) in the  topmost 
Ämodifiable dictionary on the dictionary stack.  If ÑkeyÄ is already present 
Äin that dictionary,  ÑdefÄ simply replaces the associated value. Otherwise, 
ÑdefÄ creates a new entry for ÑkeyÄ and stores ÑvalueÄ with it.  If the current 
Ädictionary  carries  the  ÑreadonlyÄ  attribute,   ÑdefÄ  examines  the  next 
Ädictionary  below it,  and so on until a modifiable dictionary  has  been 
Äfound; the association is made in that dictionary.Ç|

ÇpÄAnother operator,  ÑnameÄ, has exactly the same effects as ÑdefÄ, but expects 
Äits operands in the converse order.Ç|

ÇxÄEXAMPLE:Ç|
ÇyÄ/n 17 def =>Ñ associates 'n' with numeral '17'Ç|

Äby  ÑdeletefileÄ.Ç|

ÇxÄEXAMPLE:Ç|

Äobject  in the same eVM.  ÑdiscardÄ actually erases the master descriptions that Äare stored with the object values in the eVM. Since Ñdiscard Äcannot eliminate Äreferences made to the deleted objects, eVM objects to be accessed generally Äshould  be examined with Ñvalid Ä(which checks the master description); ÑvalidÄ willÄ fail on objects previously erased by ÑdiscardÄ.Ç|

ÇpÄdivides the first by the second numeral operand,  or the elements of the 
Äfirst array by the corresponding elements of the second,  or all elements 
Äof  the array by the same numeral, or a numeral by all elements of an array.  ÄTwo array operands need to  match  in length. Any numerical types, and mixed Ätypes, are acceptable; the computation is done following conversion to ÑdoubleÄ Ätype, and the result is returned in the type of the pivotal operand. ÑUndefinedÄ  Äoperand  values,  and ÑundefinedÄ  quotients  produce  ÑundefinedÄ elements  in  theÄ result.Ç|

ÇpÑdivÄ pops both operands and pushes the quotient on the operand  stack.  If 
Äthe pivotal operand is an array, the values of that array are replaced by 
Äthe values of the quotient, and the array is returned on the stack.Ç|

ÇpÑdrawsamplesÄ lets you display many samples quickly and economically: it marks Äeach sample only by one pixel, automatically generates a linear abscissa, and Äoffsets and scales the samples as it uses them. Drawing mode 2 is useful when Äseveral sample sets are superimposed on a screen and need to be selectively Äerasable (in mode 2, the first pass marks the samples, and the second pass Äundoes the effects of the first pass). Mode 0 first clears the entire virtual Äscreen, then marks the pixels belonging to the samples. Mode 1 or 3 mark or Äwhite out the pixels belonging to the samples.Ç|

ÇpÄpops  two  objects from the operand stack and pushes the  boolean  value 
ÑtrueÄ if these are equal, ÑfalseÄ if not. The definition of equality depends 
Äon the class of objects being compared. Simple objects are equal if their 
Äclasses and values are the same.  Composite objects are considered  equal 
Äonly if they share the same value; separate values are considered unequal 
Äeven if all elements of the value are the same.  In particular, ÑeqÄ is not 
Älikely  to have the expected effect when used to compare  strings.Ñ eqÄ does not Äconsider attributes of the operands, exceptÑ externalÄ. External objects are Äconsidered equal if they resolve to the same object in the same eVM.Ç|

ÇpÄFor the comparison of numerals, all types are automatically converted to ÑdoubleÄ. Numeral values can be compared with Ñundefined.Ç|

You now can enter D Äinstructions from the console to study the problem (inspecting stacks, Ävariables, etc). ÑcontinueÄ will resume execution of the context, whereas Ñstop Ä orÄ ÑabortÄ will terminate that context or all contexts currently on the execution Ästack. You can invoke Ñerror Äfrom your own programs to handle errors discovered Äby your D code, using a negative error code (positive codes belong to the D Ämachine itself); if ÑerrorÄ does not know an error code, it simply displays the Änumeral value).Ç|

Ç      mÄdest_array index1 src_array ÅfaxÄ dest_array index2Ç|

ÇpÄAccepts any combination of external and internal source and destination. 
ÄIf  these  objects  are lists,  a copy of the source is  created  in  the 
Ädestination beginning at Ñindex1Ä.  The returned Ñindex2Ä points to the first 
Äelement following the modified elements in Ñdest_listÄ.  With  arrays,  ÑfaxÄ 
Ärequires matching source and destination types; the function is analogous 
Äto that with lists. When used with byte arrays, ÑfaxÄ is restricted to even valuesÄ for indices and faxed string lengths; for moving internal text strings, use ÑtextÄ in place of ÑfaxÄ (ÑtextÄ can use even and uneven indices and lengths).Ç|

ÇyÄ/Nexp name /ExpList nameÇ|

ÇpÄA permanent list of 100 elements is created in eVM 17, and references to

ÇpÄfills the rectangle spanned up between two coordinate pairs with a solid color Äor a pattern. Coordinates ÑxÄ and ÑyÄ can be given as matched, but separate arrays Äor lists, or as one array or list of alternating x/y elements. Coordinates referÄ to screen pixels, with 0/0 at the top, left corner (of the graph screen in use)Ä and positive increments specifying right/down displacements. Ñparams Äis a list Äor array with the following elements:Ç|

ÇhÅfindÇ| mÄkey Åfind ÄobjÇ|

ÇpÄsearches  for  ÑkeyÄ in the current vocabulary,  which is defined  by  the 
Ädictionaries  currently  on the dictionary stack.  ÑFindÄ begins  with  the 
Ätopmost  dictionary  and  proceeds  towards  the  bottom  of  the  stack, 
Äreturning  on the operand stack the first object found to  be  associated 
Äwith the ÑpassiveÄ name Ñkey.Ä If ÑkeyÄ is not found, an error is executed.

ÑFindÄ  looks up ÑkeyÄ in exactly the same manner as the executive  looks  up 
Äactive  names that it encounters during execution,  but it transfers  the 
Äassociated  object  to  the  operand stack  rather  than  executing  that 
Äobject.Ç|

ÇxÄEXAMPLE:Ç|
ÇyÄ/average { add 2 div } defÇ|
ÇyÄ/average find => { add 2 div }Ç|
ÇyÄ5 10 average => 7.5Ç|
ÇyÄ/x 20 defÇ|
ÇyÄx => 20Ç|

ÇpÄLine  2 returns the body of a procedure on the operand stack,  and  thus 
Ämakes it amenable to modification or other manipulations by the  program. 
ÄNote  that  reference  to the active name of  the  procedure  immediately 
Äinvokes  that  procedure (line 3) and does ÑnotÄ present it  on  the  stack 
Älike, e.g., a numeral object (line 5). This asymmetry reflects the common 
Äusage  of  these objects:  calling the name of a procedure  or  operator 
Äeffects execution,  whereas,  with other objects, the object is pushed on 
Äthe operand stack.Ç|

ÇpÄfinds volume and directory identifiers needed by other file system operators. 
ÄThe first form of usage looks up the volume identifier of a volume known by Äname; it returns as directory identifier that of the volume's root directory, Äwhich is '2'. Volumes of the Apple file system have negative identifiers that Äare decrementd in the order in which volumes are mounted (the boot volume is Äalways -1). Positive volume identifiers are used by file systems directly Äadministrated by the D machine and not accessible through the Apple operating Äsystem (e.g. a disk attached to the laser printer). The second form of usage Ädetermines a directory identifier starting from a volume and some directory Älocated between the root and the searched directory using a partial path Ästring.Ç|

ÇhÅfindfilesÇ| mÄvolid dirid (template) list†1Ä string ÅfindfilesÄ list†2Ä boolÇ|

ÇpÄscans  the  disk  directory specified by ÑvolidÄ and ÑdiridÄ for filenames matchingÄ Ñtemplate Ä(which may include one or several '*' wildcard characters). Ñlist§1Ä and ÑstringÄ provide buffers for constructing a list of matching files; if these Äbuffers cannot hold all matching files, ÑboolÄ is true, else false. The filelist Ñlist§2Ä contains one list object for each file, whose elements are the file name Äand file name extension (strings), data fork and resource fork lengths Ä(integers), attribute (integer), and a list of day, month, year, hour, and Äminute referring to the time of file creation. The file attributes are in Apple Änotation (e.g., mask 16: directory). Entries in the filelist are automatically  Äsorted  by three keys (in descending order):   (1)  first  directories,  then  Äordinary  files,  (2) 
Äfilename extensions (alphabetically), and (3) filenames (alphabetically).

ÄThe  ÑstringÄ operand is used for storing filename and  extension  strings, 
Äand  the  ÑlistÄ operand accepts the main list and secondary lists  of  the 
Ätable. Ñlist 
Äand  ÑstringÄ  need to be dimensioned to hold the expected number  of  file 
Äentries;   if  one  of  these  dimensions  is  insufficient,   only   the 
Äaccommodated  subset of files is returned (this is indicated by ÑboolÄ).  Each 
Äfile  entry  consumes  7 objects of ÑlistÄ and 74  bytes  of  ÑstringÄ.  The 
Äcomposite objects receiving the file directory need to reside in internal 
ÄVM.Ç|

ÇhÅfloorÇ| mÄnum ÅfloorÄ numÇ| 1 ls
Ç       mÄarray ÅfloorÄ arrayÇ|

ÇpÄreturns the floor (i.e. the nearest integer value smaller than the operand) of Äa numeral, or replaces all elements of an array by their floor values and Äreturns the array object. The numerical type of the result is that of the Äoperand. An ÑundefinedÄ operand value produces an ÑundefinedÄ result value.Ç|

ÇhÅforÇ| mÄinitial step limit proc ÅforÄ --Ç|

ÇpÄexecutes ÑprocÄ repeatedly,  passing it a sequence of numeral values  from 
ÑinitialÄ  by  steps of ÑstepÄ to ÑlimitÄ.  ÑForÄ maintains an  internal  control 
Ävariable,  which it first sets toÑ initialÄ. At the beginning of each cycle 
Ä(including  the first),  Ñfor Äcompares the control variable with  the  the 
Ätermination value ÑlimitÄ;  if ÑlimitÄ has not been exceededÑ,  Äit pushes  the 
Äcontrol variable on the operand stack,  executeÑs proc,Ä  adds ÑstepÄ to  theÑ 
Äcontrol variable, and begins a new cycle. If the ÑlimitÄ has been exceeded, 
Äexecution resumes with the object in normal sequence after ÑforÄ.Ç|

ÇpÄThe  termination  condition  depends on the sign of  ÑstepÄ.  If  ÑstepÄ  is 
Äpositive,  termination  occurs when the control variable is greater  than 
ÑlimitÄ.  If Ñstep Äis negative, termination occurs when the control variable 
Äis smaller tha ÑlimitÄ.  If ÑinitialÄ itself meets the termination condition, 
ÑforÄ  does not executeÑ procÄ at all.  If ÑprocÄ  executes  ÑexitÄ,  termination 
Äoccurs regardless of the state of the control variable.Ç|

ÇpÄThe value of ÑprocÄ needs to reside in internal VM.Ç|

ÇxÄEXAMPLE:Ç|
ÇyÄ0 1 5 { } for => 0 1 2 3 4 5Ç|
ÇyÄ1 2 1 10 {mul} for => 10!Ç|

Ç         mÄlist proc ÅforallÄ --Ç| 1 ls
Ç         mÄdict procÅ forallÄ --Ç|

ÇpÄapplies ÑprocÄ to each element of a composite object. If that object is an 
ÑarrayÄ  or ÑlistÄ,  ÑforallÄ starts with the element at index 0,  pushes  that 
Äelement on the operand stack, executes ÑprocÄ, and proceeds so sequentially 
Äthrough  all elements.Ç|

ÇpÄIf  the composite object is a dictionary,  ÑforallÄ pushes first  the  key, 
Äthen the associated object,  and executes ÑprocÄ for that entry  pair.  The 
Äsequence in which entry pairs are processed is arbitrary, and new entries 
Äcreated  through the execution of ÑprocÄ may or may not be included in  the 
Äenumeration.Ç|

ÇpÄIf  the  length  of the composite object is zero or if the  object  is  a 
Ädictionary with no used entries,  ÑforallÄ does not execute ÑprocÄ at all. If 
ÑprocÄ invokes the ÑexitÄ operator, Ñforall Äterminates prematurely.Ç|

ÇpÑdict,  list,Ä ÑarrayÄ, and ÑprocÄ values must be in internal VM.Ç|

Äelements into the sum, and returns the mean thus computed. Note that ÑmeanÄ 
Ätakes  any  numeral type,  but does its calculations  always  in  ÑsingleÄ,

Ätherein.Ç|

ÇxÄEXAMPLE:Ç|
ÇyÄSavedPrograms /MyProg get frombox userdict /MyProg putÇ|

ÇpÄrefers  to  a  dictionary of saved programs to find  a  box  object  and

Ächaracters  on the operand stack.  ÑfromconsoleÄ waits for the operator  to 
Äenter  a  complete phrase (but allows other contexts, like screen drawing Äprocedures, to be executed while it is waiting for a phrase). If  the 
Äconsole screen holds several phrases (because the  operator 
Ähas typed ahead),  phrases are returned one for each instance of ÑfromconsoleÄ.Ç|

ÇpÄgets a single element from the value of an array,  list,  or dictionary. 
ÄIf the first element is anÑ arrayÄ or ÑlistÄ,  the second operand is expected 
Äto be a numeral in the range between 0 and n-1,  where n is the length of 
Äthe composite object.  If the first operand is a dictionary,  the  second

ÇyÄx 0 getÇ|
ÇyÄx { 2 copy lt { exch } if pop } forall => 9Ç|

ÇpÄThis  finds  the maximum of an array.  Line 2 seeds an  arbitrary  array 
Äelement as the running maximum (top element of the stack).  Line 3  works 
Äthrough all array elements, comparing each element to the running maximum 
Äand passing on the larger of the two values.  The comparison is done with 
Äa copy of the two values; the original values are exchanged such that the 
Älarger value is below the smaller one,  and the smaller value is  popped, 
Äleaving behind the new running maximum.Ç|

ÇpÄThis  is  also  an example of advanced stack usage.  The  code  is  very 
Äcompact,  but its effect is not obvious from superficial reading.  Clever 
Ästack use,  obviously,  can turn into dangerous acrobatics.  The  largest

ÇhÅmakegraphscreenÇ| mÄscreen# left top width height screendict ÅmakegraphscreenÄ --Ç|

ÇpÄcreates a graphical screen on the virtual terminal. Graphical screens can be 
Älocated in the central area of the screen (location and size then are as Äspecified in Ñtop,..,heightÄ, in units of pixels), or they occupy a fixed area Äalong the bottom of the screen (for use by menus, specified by giving zero Ävalues for the coordinate and dimension parameters). The created screen is Äassociated with a Ñscreen# Ä in the range 1-9 (these numbers can be used randomly;Ä screen 0 is permanently associated with the console screen). If a screen Äalready existed under Ñscreen#Ä, it is discarded before the new screen is set up.Ç|

ÇpÄThe contents of graphical screens need to be drawn using a procedure written inÄ D. Mouse clicks over the screen also are responded to by code contained in a D Äprocedure. The execution of these procedures is scheduled automatically by the DÄ mill (you need not poll the VT for such requests).Ñ ÄThe respective procedures Äare expected to be available under the names 'drawscreen' and 'mouseclick' in ÑscreendictÄ. When during the lifetime of the screen, the mill recognizes an eventÄ that requires a response by one of these procedures, it pushes ÑscreendictÄ on Äthe dictionary stack and executes the respective active name. Ñdrawscreen Äor ÑmouseclickÄ draw the screen content or respond to the mouse and close up by Äpopping ÑscreendictÄ from the dictionary stack.Ç|

ÇpÄpops  two  objects from the operand stack and pushes the  boolean  value 
ÑtrueÄ if they are not equal,  ÑfalseÄ otherwise.  The operands have to be of 
Äthe same class.  Equality of simple objects requires that their values be

ÇhÅnextobjectÇ| mÄVMid/obj ÅnextobjÄ objÇ|

ÇpÄretrieves an internal or external object from VM or eVM. When ÑVMidÄ is specifiedÄ as operand and has the value zero, ÑnextobjectÄ returns the first parent object Ädefined in the internal VM. When ÑVMidÄ is not zero, ÑnextobjectÄ returns the first Äobject defined in the permanent part of the eVM (ÑVMidÄ negative) or the last Äobject defined in the temporary part of the eVM (ÑVMidÄ positive). When a 
Äcomposite object is specified as the operand, Ñnextobject Äretrieves the next Äobject in sequence with the operand object in the operand's VM or eVM. VM or ÄpermanentÑ ÄeVM objects are retrieved in the temporal order of their creation, Äwhereas temporary eVM objects are retrieved in the reverse order of creation.Ç|

ÇxÄEXAMPLE:Ç|
ÇyÄ0 { nextobject { _ } { exit } ifelse } loopÇ|
ÇyÄ... shows you any parent VM object in your machineÇ|

ÇpÄIn this example, the name '_' refers to a procedure that is introduced with the
Ä Ñstartup.dÄ file; '_' displays a description of the top element of the operand Ästack. The Ñloop Äprocedure is primed by pushing 0 on the operand stack; ÑnextobjectÄ, hence, starts the scan at the beginning of the VM. Since each Äretrieved object remains on the stack ('_' does not consume the displayed stack Äelement), the next loop iteration will present that object to ÑnextobjectÄ, Ädirecting ÑnextobjectÄ to retrieve the next VM object in the sequence of Äcreation.Ç|

Ästring, which is appended to ÑstringÄ starting at element ÑindexÄ (the value
Äof Ñstring Ähas to reside in internal VM). Ñwidth Ädetermines the 
Äwidth  in bytes of the new string (by its absolute  value;  an  Ñundefined 
Ävalue  selects  the  minimal  necessary width)  and  chooses  among  left 
Äadjustment  (negative  sign) or right  adjustment  (positive  sign); ÑstringÄ  is Ä padded with spaces as necessary.  The sign of ÑformatÄ  selects 
Äbetween    fixed-point    (negative)   or    floating-point    (positive) 
Ärepresentation  of  ÑnumÄ,  the  value of Ñformat Äspecifies  the  number  of 
Äfractional   digits.   An  ÑundefinedÄ  ÑformatÄ  value   selects   automatic 
Äformatting,  and  the  value of ÑformatÄ is ignored if ÑnumÄ is  an  integer.

ÇhÅportsessionÇ| mÄ[params] /out /in /port ÅportsessionÄ boolÇ|

ÇpÄopens a session on a bi-directional ÑportÄ. Current ports areÇ|
ÇyÄserialportA (Modem)Ç|
ÇyÄserialportB (Printer)Ç|
ÇyÄPAPport (Laserprinter via Ethertalk)Ç|

ÇpÑportsession Äcreates a transparent polling loop for monitoring the port, and
Äinvokes the port service procedures associated with the names given in the
Äoperands, /in and /out. Procedure ÑoutÄ, is executed when the port is ready to Ätransmit data (from the D machine to a target). Ñout Äshould be associated with a Äprocedure that submits a string array as the top element of the operand stack; Äif no data are to be transferred, a Ñnull Äobject is submitted, instead. ÄConversely, when a phrase of data has been received from the port, the active Äname,Ñ inÄ, is executed. ÑinÄ should be associated with a procedure that pops the Äreceived string submitted to it on the operand stack and consumes the data Äbefore it returns control. The names, ÑinÄ and ÑoutÄ, can be dynamically associated Äwith different procedures in order to implement complex transaction protocols. ÄWhile it serves the port,Ñ portsession Äalso permits the D mill to respond to Äother events that require the scheduling of D procedures (such as 'drawscreen' Ärequests). On the other hand, only one port session can be in progress at any Ätime, so port sessions on one or several ports cannot be interleaved (attempts
Ägive an error). The port session is terminated by executing ÑcloseportÄ, ÑstopÄ, or ÑabortÄ.Ç|

ÇpÄThe contents of the ÑparamsÄ list is port-specific. For the serial ports,
ÑparamsÄ is composed of:Ç| 1 ls

ÇyÄ[ baudrate stopbits parityoption <b closebytes > <b receivebuffer > ]Ç|

ÇpÑbaudrateÄ values 0, 1,... select the default (9600), 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, Ä19200, 57600 baudrates. Ñstopbits Ävalues of 0, 1,.. select between the default Ä(1), 1, 1.5, or 2 stopbits. ÑparityoptionsÄ 0, 1,.. select between default (no Äparity), no parity, odd parity, or even parity. Any of the given Ñclosebytes Ä(up Äto 10 total) is considered as the terminating byte of a received phrase (e.g. Ä\n). The Ñreceivbuffer Äneeds to hold at least one full received string (whose Älength will depend on the device or your protocol); a string handed to ÑinÄ is a
Äsubstring of ÑreceivebufferÄ.Ç|

ÇpÄFor the PAP (Printer Access Protocol, specific to Apple printers) port, Ñparams Äspecifies:Ç| 1 ls

ÇyÄ[ IP_address <b closebytes > <b receivebuffer >Ç|

ÇpÑIP_addressÄ is a long integer that specifies the 4-byte Internet address of the Äprinter. ÑclosebytesÄ and ÑreceivebufferÄ are as under the serial ports (see above).
ÄThe printer expects to receive PostScript code; it returns status information Äand messages initiated by the received PostScript instructions. Note that unlikeÄ serial ports the PAP port can transmit messages that contain any byte values Ä(thus there are no 'control' characters that are intercepted and interpreted by Äthe communication channel itself). You can use the operator ÑfindnodesÄ to locate Äprinters on the network (together with their IP addresses).Ç|

ÇxÄEXAMPLEÇ|

ÇyÄ/sendbuf 80 /b array defÇ|
ÇyÄ/to { sendbuf fromconsole not { null } if } defÇ|
ÇyÄ/from { toconsole } defÇ|
ÇyÄ[ 0 0 0 (\n) 80 /b array ] /to /from /serialportA portsessionÇ|

ÇpÄThis example establishes a dumb terminal, which transmits keyboard phrases to
Äthe target and displays received text on the console. In the form shown,
Äterminal operation would require a 'command_esc' interrupt and 'closeport'
Äcommand (termination could be more elegantly initiated by a mouse click).Ç|

ÇpÄpops  the  top three elements from the operand stack  and  replaces  the 
ÑarrayÄ  element at ÑindexÄ by the ÑnumÄeral,  or the ÑlistÄ element at ÑindexÄ  by 
ÑanyÄ  object,  or  associates the ÑnameÄ with ÑanyÄ objectÑ Äin  the  dictionary 
ÑdictÄ (replacing an existing association of ÑnameÄ by Ñany Äor creating a  new 
Äone for Ñname Äand ÑanyÄ).  ÑIndexÄ must be in the range 0 to n-1,  where n  is 
Äthe  length  of the destination array or list.  The  receiving  composite 
Äobject may reside in internal or external VM.Ç|

Ç      mÄarray†1Ä array†2Ä ÅpwrÄ array†1Ç|

ÇpÄraises a  base† Ä(first operand) to a  power† Ä(second operand). All numeric types Äare accepted and converted to Ñdouble Äbefore computing the power; the result is Äconverted back to the type of the pivotal operand. With an array as the pivotal Ä operand,  all 
Äelements of that array are replaced by the power,  and the modified  array 
Äis returned on the stack.  A numeral used as the second operand is expanded to Äserve as 
Äexponent for all elements of an array.Ç|

ÇpÑPwrÄ returns Ñundefined Äwith ÑundefinedÄ operands or results (cave  zero 
Äor negative bases). The operands of ÑpwrÄ have to reside in internal VM.Ç|

ÇhÅreadfileÇ| mÄvolid dirid (filename) string ÅreadfileÄ data_fork resource_forkÇ|

ÇpÄReads  the data and resource forks of the specified file into Ñstring  Äand  Äreturns the respective substrings. The resource fork is prefixed by 8 bytes that
Ä are lifted from the internal file specification and describe the nature and Äparent program of the file ('TEXTDDDD' is used in D text files).Ç|

ÇpÄThe values of the operands have to reside in internal VM.Ç|

ÇxÄSEE ALSO: ÅmkreadÇ| 1 ls

ÇhÅreleaseÇ| mÄeVMid ÅreleaseÄ --Ç|

ÇpÄpops the numeral ÑeVMidÄ from the operand stack. Releases an external VM in

ÇxÄSEE ALSO:Å initiate, evms, evmstatus, updateÇ| 1 ls

ÇhÅremovescreenÇ| mÄscreen# Åremovescreen --Ç|

ÇpÄremoves the screen specified by the screen number (1-9). Screen 0 (console) 
Äcannot be removed. If the screen does not exist,Ñ removescreenÄ has no effect. If Äthe screen is a text screen, the text buffer of the screen (held in upper VM) isÄ freed, and the VM is re-packed. A ÑrestoreÄ operation that would remove the Ädictionary associated with a graphical screen needs to be preceded by a ÑremovescreenÄ operation for that screen.Ç|

ÇhÅrepeatÇ| mÄn proc ÅrepeatÄ --Ç|

ÇpÄexecutes ÑprocÄ ÑnÄ times,  where n is a non-negative numeral. ÑRepeatÄ removes 
Äboth operands from the stack before executing ÑprocÄ for the first time.  If 
ÑprocÄ  executes the ÑexitÄ operator,  ÑrepeatÄ terminates  prematurely.  ÑRepeatÄ 
Äleaves no results of its own on the stack, but ÑprocÄ may do so.Ç|

ÇxÄEXAMPLE:Ç|

ÇhÅrestoreÇ| mÄsavebox ÅrestoreÄ --Ç|

ÇpÄreclaims VM space and optionally restores stack contents. The effects of ÑrestoreÄ depend on whether ÑsaveboxÄ was subjected to ÑcapsaveÄ.Ç|

ÇpÄIf ÑcapsaveÄ was not applied, ÑrestoreÄ checks whether any stacks hold any Ädiscardable objects or whether the dictionary of a graphical screen is Ädiscardable. If so, ÑrestoreÄ takes no action and signals an error. If not, ÑrestoreÄ removes from the internal VM all objects created following the ÑsaveÄ Äoperation that created ÑsaveboxÄ. The space freed by these objects is added to theÄ freespace of the VM. Stacks are ÑnotÄ modified (except for popping ÑsaveboxÄ).Ç|

ÇpÄIf ÑsaveboxÄ had been subjected to ÑcapsaveÄ, only objects created between the ÑsaveÄ operation that created ÑsaveboxÄ and the ÑcapsaveÄ operation that capped ÑsaveboxÄ Äwill be discarded from the internal VM. In addition, the dictionary and operand 
Ästack contents present during the Ñsave operation Äthat created ÑsaveboxÄ are Äretored.Ç|

ÇpÄIn any case, ÑrestoreÄ deletes from remaining internal dictionaries all Äassociations made to any discarded object, and replaces in remaining internal Älists all elements that represent discarded objects by ÑnullÄ objects.Ç|

ÇpÄperforms  a  circular  shift of the objects Ñany§n-1Ä through  Ñany§0Ä  on  the 
Äoperand  stack by the amount ÑjÄ.  Positive ÑjÄ effects upward motion  on  the 
Ästack whereas negative ÑjÄ effects downward motion.Ç|

ÇpÑnÄ  must be a non-negative numeral.  The operand stack must provide  space 
Äfor at least ÑnÄ additional objects.Ç|

ÇpÄEach upward shift moves ÑnÄ elements on the stack up by one  position;  the 
Ätop  element then is the moved down into the vacant stack  position.  Each 
Ädownward  shift  removes the bottonmost of ÑnÄ elements from the  stack  and 
Äslides  the  other  Ñn-1Ä  top elements down  by  one  position;  the  stack

ÇhÅsearchÇ| mÄstring seek ÅsearchÄ Ñif found:Ä  post match pre true,  Ñelse  Ästring

ÇpÄlooks  for  the  first occurence of the string  ÑseekÄ  within  ÑstringÄ  and 
Äreturns results of this search on the oeprand stack. The topmost result is 
Äa boolean that indicates whether the search succeeded.Ç|

ÇpÄIf  ÑsearchÄ finds a subsequence of ÑstringÄ whose elements are equal to  the 
Äelements of ÑseekÄ,  it splits ÑstringÄ into three segments:  ÑpreÄ, the portion 
Äof ÑstringÄ preceding the match;  ÑmatchÄ,  the portion of ÑstringÄ that matches 
ÑseekÄ;  ÑpostÄ,  the remainder of ÑstringÄ.  It then pushes the string  objectsÑ 
ÑpostÄ,  ÑmatchÄ, and ÑpreÄ on rthe operand stack, followed by the boolean ÑtrueÄ. 
ÄAll three of these strings are substrings sharing intervals pof the  value 
Äof the original ÑstringÄ.Ç|

ÇpÄIf  ÑsearchÄ does not find a match,  it pushes the original Ñstring Äand  the

ÇpÄreturns the sine of the operand value, which is interpreted to be in 
Äunits of radians. Any numeral or array type is accepted, and the result is Äreturned in the same type. With an array operand, the array elements are Äreplaced by their sines, and the array is pushed back on the stack. ÑUndefined Äoperand values yield an Ñundefined Äresult.Ç|

ÇxÄEXAMPLES:Ç|

Ç       mÄarray ÅsqrtÄ arrayÇ|

ÇpÄcomputes the square root of the operand value. Any operand type is accepted; Äthe result is returned in the same type. The elements of an array operand are Äreplaced by their square roots, and the array is pushed back on the stack.  ÑUndefined Äoperand values yield an Ñundefined Äresult, and an ÑundefinedÄ value is Äreturned also for a negative operand value.Ç|

ÇxÄSEE ALSO:Å pwrÇ|

ÇhÅstartÇ| mÄany ÅstartÄ --Ç|

ÇpÄpops the top object from the executions stack and pushes ÑanyÄ (any  active 
Äobject)  onto the execution stack.  ÑstartÄ thus swaps control  between  the 
Äcurrently  executing  composite object and  ÑanyÄ.  Typically,  the  removed 
Äobject is a string, and Ñany Äis a procedure defined during the execution of 
Äthat string. This effects transfer of control from a string to a procedure 
Äwhile freeing up the buffer that held the string being executed.Ç|

ÇxÄSEE ALSO: ÅexecÇ| 1 ls

ÇhÅstopÇ| mÄ-- ÅstopÄ --Ç|

ÇpÄpops  the  execution  stack  back to the  level  of  the  latest  ÑstoppedÄ 
Äoperator  and  pushes the booleanÑ trueÄ on  the  operand  stack.  Execution 
Äcontinues with the object immediately following the ÑstoppedÄ operator  that 
Äinvoked  the context of ÑstopÄ.  It thus appears that ÑstoppedÄ  returned  the 
Ävalue  ÑtrueÄ,  whereas  in  the case of normal completion  of  the  invoked 
Äcontext it returns ÑfalseÄ.Ç|

ÇpÑstopÄ does not affect the operand or dictionary stacks. Any objects pushed 
Äthere  during  the execution of the ÑstoppedÄ  context  remain  there.  ÑstopÄ 
Äcannot  drop  the execution stack below the latest instance of  a  ÑabortedÄ 
Äoperator (attempts produce an error).Ç|

ÇpÑstopÜ  Äis  normally used to provide for an exceptional  termination  of  a 
Äcontext  (like  of  a procedure that detects a  condition  that  precludes 
Änormal completion).  Because the mechanism can skip any number of  pending 
Äprocedure returns,  a context can be terminated from a contained low-level 
Äprocedure  without  need  for  an organized  retreat  through  all  higher 
Äprocedures involved.Ç|Ä 

ÇxÄSEE ALSO: Åstopped, exit, abortÇ| 1 ls

ÇhÅstoppedÇ| mÄany ÅstoppedÄ boolÇ|

ÇpÄexecutes  ÑanyÄ,  which  is  typically but not necsaarily  a  procedure  or 
Äexecutable  string.  If ÑanyÄ runs to completion normally,  ÑstoppedÄ  returns 
ÑfalseÄ on the operand stack. If ÑanyÄ terminates prematurely as the result of 
Äexecuting ÑstopÄ,  ÑstoppedÄ returns ÑtrueÄ on the operand stack.  Regardless of 
Äthe  outcome,  execution is resumed at the next object in normal  sequence 
Äafter ÑstoppedÄ.Ç|

ÇpÄsubtracts  two  numerals and returns their  difference,  or  subtracts  the

ÑarrayÄ, or subtracts all elements of ÑarrayÄ from the value of ÑnumÄ.Ç|

ÇpÄAll types of numeral values  and their combinations are accepted. All operands Äare converted to ÑdoubleÄ before the subtraction is done, and the result is Äreturned in the type of the pivotal operand. ÑUndefinedÄ operand values are Äpropagated into the difference; arithmetical overflow also yields an Ñundefined Äresult.Ç|

ÇpÄinserts a character field of |ÑwidthÄ| characters into ÑstringbufÄ,  starting

ÑstringbufÄ  and  the  updated index (of the  first  element  following  the 
Äinserted field) for use by subsequent ÑtextÄ or ÑnumberÄ operators.Ç|

ÇpÑobjÄ  can be a string,  name,  operator,  or numeral.  A string  value  is 
Ärepresented  literally,  a name in text form,  an operator by its name  in

Each Äinstance of Ñtoken Äapplied to ÑstringÄ consumes the text equivalent of one simple Äor one complete composite object and returns in ÑpostÄ the remainder of Ñstring ÄandÄ the converted object, ÑanyÄ, followed by ÑtrueÄ. If ÑstringÄ contains no further Äobject, the original Ñstring Äis returned followed by ÑfalseÄ.Ç|
ÇxÄEXAMPLE:Ç|
ÇyÄ(token 1 2 garbage) token => (1 2 garbage) token trueÇ|
ÇyÄ(1 2 garbage) token => (2 garbage) 1 trueÇ|
ÇyÄ(2 garbage) token => (garbage) 2 trueÇ|
ÇyÄ(garbage) token => () garbage trueÇ|
ÇyÄ() token => () falseÇ|

ÇhÅtoqueueÇ| mÄstring ÅtoqueueÄ --Ç|

ÇpÄremoves  ÑstringÄ from the operand stack and writes the contents of  ÑstringÄ 
Äinto the edit field of the virtual console screen. This operation is equivalent Äto entering the contents of ÑstringÄ on the keyboard of the virtual console (and Ätypically will be executed by the D mill).Ç|

ÇxÄSEE ALSO:Å toconsoleÇ| 1 ls

ÇhÅtotextscreenÇ| mÄstring screen# ÅtotextscreenÄ --Ç|

ÇpÄappends the values of ÑstringÄ to the text currently contained in the text memory
Ä of screen Ñscreen#Ä. If the screen capacity is exceeded, the appended string willÄ be silently truncated.Ç|

ÇxÄSEE ALSO: ÅfromtextscreenÇ| 1 ls
ÇhÅtrueÇ| mÄ-- ÅtrueÄ trueÇ|

ÇpÄpushes a boolean object whose value is ÑtrueÄ on the operand stack.Ç|

ÇxÄSEE ALSO: Åfalse, and, or, not ,xorÇ| 1 ls

ÇhÅtypeÇ| mÄnum ÅtypeÄ /nameÇ| 1 ls
Ç       mÄarray Åtype Ä/nameÇ|

ÇpÄdetermines the numeral type of ÑnumÄ or ÑarrayÄ and returns in ÑstringÄ one  of 
Äthe type specifiers, 'b,w,l,s,..'.Ç|Ä 

ÇxÄSEE ALSO:Ç Åclass, ctypeÇ| 1 ls

ÇhÅunmountvolumeÇ| mÄvolumespecÅ unmountvolumeÄ --Ç|

ÇpÄunmounts a volume (file system) and ejects a removable medium (like a floppy 
Ädisk). ÑvolumespecÄ is either a numeral (volume identifier) or a string holding Äthe volume name.Ç|

ÇxÄEXAMPLE:Ç|
ÇyÄ-3 unmountvolumeÇ|
ÇyÄ(ManualBackup:) unmountvolumeÇ|

ÇxÄSEE ALSO: ÅgetvolumesÇ| 1 ls
ÇhÅupdateÇ| mÄ-- Åupdate Ä--Ç|

ÇpÄwrites  modified  information  currently  held in  cache  memory  to  the 
Äphysical storage media,  thus bringing the information actually  contained 
Äin  the  physical  media up to date.  This  operator  should  be  executed 
Äperiodically  to  ensure  that  no information is  lost  when  the  system 
Äaccidentially  shuts  down (e.g.  by power  failure).  ÑupdateÄ  usually  is 
Äinvoked from the ÑinterruptÄ procedure that is called up by the D  executive 
Äat 0.5 sec intervals. ÑupdateÄ updates all external VMs currently in use.Ç|

ÇxÄSEE ALSO:Ñ Åinitiate, releaseÇ| 1 ls

ÇhÅusedÇ| mÄdict ÅusedÄ numÇ|

ÇpÄpops ÑdictÄ from the operand stack and pushes a numeral object whose  value 
Äequals  the  number  of entries used in  ÑdictÄ.  If  ÑdictÄ  is  external,  a 
Äreference to the medium is made.Ç|

ÇxÄSEE ALSO: ÅlengthÇ| 1 ls

ÇhÅuserdictÇ| mÄ-- Åuserdict ÄdictÇ|

ÇpÄpushes the dictionary object ÑuserdictÄ on the operand stack.Ç|

ÇxÄSEE ALSO: Åsystemdict, currentdictÇ| 1 ls

ÇhÅusescreenÇ| mÄscreen# proc ÅusescreenÄ --Ç|

ÇpÄexecutes Ñproc Äwith Ñscreen#Ä as the current graphical screen. ÑusescreenÄ will 
Äre-establish the former current screen upon completion of Ñproc. ÄPrior to Äinvoking ÑprocÄ, ÑusescreenÄ pushes the horizontal and vertical dimensions of Ñscreen#Ä on the operand stack. ÑusescreenÄ permits event-driven procedures that Äsubserve a screen to interrupt contexts that involve other screens.Ç|

ÇxÄEXAMPLE:Ç|
ÇyÄ/drawscreen {Ç|
ÇyÄ2 { /height name /width nameÇ|
ÇyÄ     ..... | instructions to draw screen contentsÇ|
ÇyÄ  }Ç|

ÇhÅvalidÇ| mÄeVM_objÅ validÄ stamp (or error)Ç|

ÇpÄattempts  to  check the given ÑeVM_objÄ against the master  description  of 
ÑeVM_objÄ in the external eVM (which needs to be mounted).  If the descriptions Ämatch, the time ÑstampÄ of 
ÑeVM_objÄ is returned as a long numeral. If a mismatch is detected, an error 
Äindicating a corrupted external object is executed.  The comparison of  the 
Ädescriptions excludes the attribute.Ç|

ÇxÄSEE ALSO: ÅnextobjectÄ, ÅexternalÇ| 1 ls

ÇhÅvmstatusÇ| mÄ-- ÅvmstatusÄ total usedÇ|

ÇpÄreturns two numerals specifying the size (in bytes) of the internal VM (ÑtotalÄ) Äand the number of bytes currently used by objects stored in the VM (ÑusedÄ).Ç|

ÇxÄSEE ALSO:Å evmstatusÇ| 1 lsÄ  

ÇhÅwritefileÇ| mÄdata_fork resource_fork volid dirid (filename) ÅwritefileÄ --Ç|

ÇpÄwrites  the value of the strings, Ñdata_fork Äand Ñresource_forkÄ, into the named Äfile in directory ÑdiridÄ of volume ÑvolidÄ. Ñresource_forkÄ is prefixed by the 8-byteÄ file specifier (e.g. 'TEXTDDDD' for D text files). If the file does not exist, Ä it is created. If it already exists, the old file  contents are deleted prior Äto writing the new contents. The file is given  the attribute 0.Ç|

ÇxÄEXAMPLE:Ç|
ÇyÄ(\nThis is just a reminder!) (TEXTDDDD) -1 4999 (reminder.doc) writefileÇ|

Ç      mÄnum†1Ä num†2Ä ÅxorÄ numÇ|

ÇpÄIf the operands are booleans,Ñ xorÄ pushes their logical 'exclusive or'. If 
Äthe  operands  are  numerals, ÑxorÄ  pushes the bitwise 'exclusive or'  of  their Ä binary representations. If the binary representation of the second numeral is Äshorter than that of the first, the shorter numeral is extended by leading Äzeroes, and the operation is performed over the length of the first numeral. TheÄ result is returned in the type of the pivotal operand.Ç|

ÇxÄEXAMPLE:Ç|
ÇyÄtrue true xor => falseÇ|
Äytrue false xor => trueÇ|
ÇyÄfalse true xor => trueÇ|
ÇyÄfalse false xor => falseÇ|
